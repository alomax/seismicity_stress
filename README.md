# seismicity_stress
Software for mapping finite-fault slip with spatial correlation between seismicity and Coulomb failure stress change

Software and instructions for running the seismicity-stress mapping procedure described in:
- Lomax, A. (2024, April 8). Mapping finite-fault slip with spatial correlation between seismicity and point-source Coulomb failure stress change. arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.05437
- Lomax, A. (2024, May). Poster: Mapping finite-fault slip in 3D from spatial correlation between seismicity and point-source Coulomb stress change. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11516067

TODO: Software will be available when paper is submitted for publication.
