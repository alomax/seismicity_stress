### Software for mapping finite-fault earthquake slip with spatial correlation between seismicity and Coulomb failure stress change

Software and instructions for running the seismicity-stress mapping procedure described in:
- Lomax, A. (2024). Mapping finite-fault slip with spatial correlation between seismicity and point-source Coulomb failure stress change. arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.05437
- Lomax, A. (2024). Poster: Mapping finite-fault slip in 3D from spatial correlation between seismicity and point-source Coulomb stress change. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11516067

### TODO: Final software and instructions will be available when manuscript is submitted for publication and revised.

## Installation and Usage
1. Install elastic_stresses_py from https://github.com/kmaterna/elastic_stresses_py
2. Download or clone this ```seismicity_stress``` repository onto your computer (see the green **Code** button)
3. Working in your downloadeded, local directory ```seismicity_stress/examples/AntelopeValley```, or ```seismicity_stress/examples/Anchorage_2018```, follow the instructions and commands in ```README.txt```
